#JavaScript Learning Repository
This repository contains projects and practice exercises to solidify my understanding of JavaScript. It's part of my journey to master the core concepts of JavaScript and prepare for advanced technologies like the MERN stack.

ðŸ“Œ Features:
-> Hands-on JavaScript examples and projects.
-> Covers key concepts like:
  - Variables, Data Types, and Operators.
  - Functions, Scope, and Closures.
  - DOM Manipulation and Event Handling.
  - Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await).
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript.
  - Small applications and scripts to demonstrate practical use cases.
ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
-> To build a strong foundation in JavaScript and enhance problem-solving skills, making it easier to transition into full-stack development.

ðŸš€ Future Plans:
-> This repository will continue to grow with more examples and mini-projects as I deepen my JavaScript expertise.
